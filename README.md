# Wanderbeans - Frontend Repo

Welcome to our web application Wanderbeans. This web app should be a collection of the best coffee places around the world - sharing experiences with friends and like-minded coffeine addicts.

How it works: Add a new cafe to a city, give details what makes them special and share your personal experience in a review.


## Description

<p>This is the Frontend Repo with our SPA using React. Integrating user funcionality with signup, login, logout. Fullfilling CRUD for one model (cafes), CR for another model (reviews). User is able to have more functionality when logged in (C + UD). Styling done by using Tailwind CSS, starting on responsiveness. </p>
